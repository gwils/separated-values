This module provides integration between sv and cassava.
It lets you plug cassava's (very fast!) parser into sv's decoding layer.

Our benchmarking indicates that parsing is very expensive,
while decoding is comparatively less performance-sensitive.
So if performance matters to you, and cassava's parser is sufficient for
your needs, you might as well use it!

sv's own parser is much slower than cassava's right now, but aims to have
better error messages and keep more information for you to work with, such as
spacing, quoting, and newline information.
